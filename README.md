# Project-Landing-Page

As part of The Odin Project's - Web Development Foundation's - course, Iâ€™ll be creating an entire web page from a mock-up design provided by The Odin Project

The goal is to build a web page from the screenshot and guidelines given below:

The styling guidelines can be found here: https://i.imgur.com/IA2nAUj.png

The exercise requirements can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

In the spirit of helping others to access good resources to learn code, I chose to build a Code-Resources landing page. The self-taught developer pathway can be quite the maze. I hope sharing some of the best resources I have used in my journey, benefits someone out there.

Kindly find a screenshot of the final submission below:
